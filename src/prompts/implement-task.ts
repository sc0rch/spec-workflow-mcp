    {
      role: 'user',
      content: {
        type: 'text',
        text: `Implement ${taskId ? `task ${taskId}` : 'the next pending task'} for the "${specName}" feature.

**Context:**
- Project: ${boundProjectPath}
- Feature: ${specName}
${taskId ? `- Task ID: ${taskId}` : ''}
${context.dashboardUrl ? `- Dashboard: ${context.dashboardUrl}` : ''}

**Implementation Workflow:**

1. **Check Current Status:**
   - Use the spec-status tool with specName "${specName}" and projectPath "${boundProjectPath}" to see overall progress
   - Read .spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/tasks.md to see all tasks
   - Identify ${taskId ? `task ${taskId}` : 'the next pending task marked with [ ]'}

2. **Start the Task:**
   - Edit .spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/tasks.md directly
   - Change the task marker from [ ] to [-] for the task you're starting
   - Only one task should be in-progress at a time

3. **Read Task Guidance:**
   - Look for the _Prompt field in the task - it contains structured guidance:
     - Role: The specialized developer role to assume
     - Task: Clear description with context references
     - Restrictions: What not to do and constraints
     - Success: Specific completion criteria
   - Note the _Leverage fields for files/utilities to use
   - Check _Requirements fields for which requirements this implements

4. **Discover Existing Implementations (CRITICAL):**
   - BEFORE writing any code, search implementation logs to understand existing artifacts
   - Implementation logs are stored as markdown files in: .spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/Implementation Logs/

   **Option 1: Use grep/ripgrep for fast searches**
   \`\`\`bash
   # Search for API endpoints
   grep -r "GET\|POST\|PUT\|DELETE" ".spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/Implementation Logs/"

   # Search for specific components
   grep -r "ComponentName" ".spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/Implementation Logs/"

   # Search for integration patterns
   grep -r "integration\|dataFlow" ".spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/Implementation Logs/"
   \`\`\`

   **Option 2: Read markdown files directly**
   - Use the Read tool to examine implementation log files
   - Search for relevant sections (## API Endpoints, ## Components, ## Functions, etc.)
   - Review artifacts from related tasks to understand established patterns

   **Discovery best practices:**
   - First: Search for "API" or "endpoint" to find existing API patterns
   - Second: Search for "component" or specific component names to see existing UI structures
   - Third: Search for "integration" or "dataFlow" to understand how frontend/backend connect
   - Why this matters:
     - ❌ Don't create duplicate API endpoints - check for similar paths
     - ❌ Don't reimplement components/functions - verify utilities already don't exist
     - ❌ Don't ignore established patterns - understand middleware/integration setup
     - ✅ Reuse existing code - leverage already-implemented functions and components
     - ✅ Follow patterns - maintain consistency with established architecture
   - If initial search doesn't find expected results, refine your grep patterns
   - Document any existing related implementations before proceeding
   - If you find existing code that does what the task asks, leverage it instead of recreating

5. **Implement the Task:**
   - Follow the _Prompt guidance exactly
   - Use the files mentioned in _Leverage fields
   - Create or modify the files specified in the task
   - Write clean, well-commented code
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Test your implementation thoroughly

6. **Log Implementation (MANDATORY - must complete BEFORE marking task done):**
   - ⚠️ **STOP: Do NOT mark the task [x] until this step succeeds.**
   - A task without an implementation log is NOT complete. Skipping this step is the #1 workflow violation.
   - Call log-implementation with ALL of the following:
     - projectPath: "${boundProjectPath}"
     - specName: "${specName}"
     - taskId: ${taskId ? `"${taskId}"` : 'the task ID you just completed'}
     - summary: Clear description of what was implemented (1-2 sentences)
     - filesModified: List of files you edited
     - filesCreated: List of files you created
     - statistics: {linesAdded: number, linesRemoved: number}
     - artifacts: {apiEndpoints: [...], components: [...], functions: [...], classes: [...], integrations: [...]}
   - You MUST include artifacts (required field) to enable other agents to find your work:
     - **apiEndpoints**: List all API endpoints created/modified with method, path, purpose, request/response formats, and location
     - **components**: List all UI components created with name, type, purpose, props, and location
     - **functions**: List all utility functions with signature and location
     - **classes**: List all classes with methods and location
     - **integrations**: Document how frontend connects to backend with data flow description
   - Example artifacts for an API endpoint:
     \`\`\`json
     "apiEndpoints": [{
       "method": "GET",
       "path": "/api/todos/:id",
       "purpose": "Fetch a specific todo by ID",
       "requestFormat": "URL param: id (string)",
       "responseFormat": "{ id: string, title: string, completed: boolean }",
       "location": "src/server.ts:245"
     }]
     \`\`\`
   - Why: Future AI agents will query logs before implementing, preventing duplicate code and ensuring architecture consistency
   - This creates a searchable knowledge base — without it, implementation knowledge is lost when the conversation ends

7. **Complete the Task (only after step 6 succeeds):**
   - Confirm that log-implementation returned success in step 6
   - Verify all success criteria from the _Prompt are met
   - Run any relevant tests to ensure nothing is broken
   - Edit .spec-workflow/specs/${specName}/tasks.md directly
   - Change the task marker from [-] to [x] for the completed task
   - ⚠️ If you skipped step 6, go back now — a task marked [x] without a log is incomplete

**Important Guidelines:**
- Always mark a task as in-progress before starting work
- Follow the _Prompt field guidance for role, approach, and success criteria
- Use existing patterns and utilities mentioned in _Leverage fields
- Test your implementation before marking the task complete
- **ALWAYS call log-implementation BEFORE marking a task [x]** — this is the most-skipped step and it is mandatory
- If a task has subtasks (e.g., 4.1, 4.2), complete them in order
- If you encounter blockers, document them and move to another task
- Treat projectPath as the workspace/worktree selector for all stateful spec-workflow tool calls
- Use projectPath "${boundProjectPath}" throughout this task so worktree-local specs and approvals resolve correctly

**Tools to Use:**
- spec-status: Check overall progress
- Bash (grep/ripgrep): CRITICAL - Search existing implementations before coding (step 4)
- Read: Examine markdown implementation log files directly (step 4)
- log-implementation: MANDATORY - Record implementation details with artifacts BEFORE marking task complete (step 6)
- Edit: Directly update task markers in tasks.md file
- Read/Write/Edit: Implement the actual code changes
- Bash: Run tests and verify implementation

**View Implementation Logs:**
- All logged implementations appear in the "Logs" tab of the dashboard
- Filter by spec, task ID, or search by summary
- View detailed statistics including files changed and lines modified
- Or search directly using grep on markdown files in .spec-workflow/specs/{specName}/Implementation Logs/

Please proceed with implementing ${taskId ? `task ${taskId}` : 'the next task'} following this workflow.`
